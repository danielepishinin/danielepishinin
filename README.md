I am a postgraduate student in Software Engineering at USP, and I have been working with software development since 2020. Currently, I am specializing in developing more accessible and secure mobile applications, having worked with Android, Flutter, and React Native. Additionally, I serve as an ambassador at Google Women Techmakers, where I mentor women at Reprograma and assist in organizing community events such as DevOPS Day Campinas 2024. In my free time, I am learning SwiftUI and enjoy other activities like trekking, Krav Maga, going to the gym, reading, and visiting cafés.
