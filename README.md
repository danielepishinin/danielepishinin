I am a postgraduate student in Software Engineering at USP and have been involved in software development since 2020. Currently, I am focused on creating more accessible and secure applications, with strong expertise in ReactJS, React Native, AWS, Testing Library, Jest, GraphQL, Sentry, and Amplitude. Additionally, I serve as an ambassador for Google Women Techmakers, where I mentor women at Reprograma and help organize community events such as DevOPS Day Campinas 2024.

Outside of coding, I am learning to swim and climb. I also love paint with watercolors, sci-fi books and everything related to nature.
